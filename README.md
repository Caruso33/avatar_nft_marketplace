# Avatar Nft Marketplace

## This is the repo for the [Encode Polygon Hackathon](https://www.encode.club/polygon-hackathon)

Remarks:

This repo is based on my repos [NftMarketplace](https://github.com/Caruso33/blockchain_dapps/tree/master/nader/4_nft_marketplace)
as well as [scripts to generate initial Nfts](https://github.com/Caruso33/blockchain_dapps/tree/master/nft/multiavatar) which are now copied here to be packaged as one dapp.

The marketplace is based on a tutorial by [Nader Dabit](https://twitter.com/dabit3).  
I've developed it further however, to increase the usability for the smart contract as well as the frontend.
